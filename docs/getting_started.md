# ðŸš€ Getting Started

You can download URSC as a standalone zip file by heading to [Releases]().

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Be sure to download the version of the collection that corresponds to the version of Godot you are using. You'll see the Godot version in the name of the zip file.
>
> For example, in `ursc_1.0.0_4.2.2.zip`:
> - `1.0.0` is the version of the shader collection.
> - `4.2.2` is the version of Godot the shader collection was made with.
>
> So, you should only use URSC `1.0.0` with Godot `4.2.2`. Using different versions may result in broken shaders due to changes or missing features; therefore, they are *not supported!*

After downloading, extract the zip file into your project. The `ursc` folder extracted from the zip will contain the complete collection, including the license.

Next, you'll need to add a few [global uniforms](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/shaders/shader_reference/shading_language.html#global-uniforms). These uniforms are *mandatory* for the `spatial` shaders to work correctly:

| Name                         | Type    | Default Value |
| ---------------------------- | -----   | ------------- |
| `affine_texture_mapping`     | `bool`  | `true`        |
| `cull_distance`              | `float` | `64`          |
| `texture_filtering`          | `bool`  | `false`       |
| `vertex_snap_intensity`      | `int`   | `2`           |

You should now be able to use the shaders in your project!
