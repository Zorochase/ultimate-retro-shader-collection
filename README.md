## ðŸ“‹ Overview

Ultimate Retro Shader Collection (**_URSC_**) is a unification and enhancement of various "retro-3D" shaders sourced from the Godot community. These shaders are essential for creating authentic graphics reminiscent of the *PlayStation* (PSX) or *Nintendo 64* (N64).

This repository is home to the collection itself and a demo project which demonstrates how to use it. You can download the collection separately or get the demo executable by heading to [Releases]().

### Shader Features:
- Vertex snapping (a.k.a. *vertex jitter*)
- Affine texture mapping (a.k.a. *texture warping*)
- 3-point texture filtering (as seen on N64)
- Special "metallic/reflective" and "shiny/glossy" effects
- Basic customization through a wide range of uniforms
- Detailed customization with macros
- Bonus `canvas_item` shaders:
  - PSX-like additive/subtractive fade
  - Color reduction with dithering

### Demo Features:
- A variety of samples
- Freecam
- Control shader parameters through the menu

### Demo Controls:
- Move: WASD; space or E to move up; shift or Q to move down
- Increase/decrease movement speed: mouse wheel up/down
- Toggle menu: escape
- Toggle fullscreen: F11 or Alt + Enter (Option + Enter on macOS)

## ðŸ˜Ž Credits

Of course, this collection would not've been possible without the amazing work done by:

- [MenacingMecha](https://menacingmecha.itch.io/)
  - This collection derives from his [PSX](https://github.com/MenacingMecha/godot-psx-style-demo) and [N64](https://github.com/MenacingMecha/godot-n64-shader-demo) shaders. If you need inspiration for creating your own retro-3D game, definitely have a look at his work!
- [Zacksly](https://zacksly.itch.io/)
  - The "shiny" effect comes from their [PSX Pickup Shader](https://zacksly.itch.io/psx-pickup-shader) for Godot 3.
